## From Monolith to Microservices, nothing changes
Airbnb initiated like many software companies with a few motivated engineers to build a minimum viable product to reach their market.

The product started with a Monolith architecture inside a Monorepo (access the full [Airbnb’s Monorepo Journey here](https://qeunit.com/blog/airbnbs-monorepo-journey-to-quality-engineering/)). Airbnb grew from 2008 in this model, with features completed by small teams with limited dependencies.

>Figure 1: Airbnb revenues were growing up to $2.6B in 2017.

But in 2017, the centralized architecture reached its limits:

- Velocity of software changes decrease
- Parallel evolution faces limiting factors
- Component ownership is confused.
Airbnb decided to embrace Microservices.

The existing Monorepo is split between front and back-office (respectively Hyperloop for Speed and Treehouse for stability). Microservices appear in each repo, while a dedicated service migration team is responsible for the transition of components.

>Figure 2: The architecture evolution from Monolith to Microservices at Airbnb.

years later in 2020, the business is going to [reach $5B revenues](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1193134/airbnb-revenue-worldwide/) (until the COVID hit). Teams grew and continue to migrate services. But still, the original issue is back again: features require changes on multiple services and different teams.

`Driven by their architecture mantra “we cannot impact business growth”, engineering teams step back to find sustainable solutions to these recurring problems.`

## The challenges of evolving Airbnb’s architecture

Airbnb has the challenge to implement architecture solutions solving today’s problems that also support tomorrow’s scale; that’s Quality Engineering problem-solving.

The company relies on an incremental and iterative process:

1. Define the problem(s)
2. Find solution(s) to improve
3. Make the solution used
4. Increase the solution adoption
5. Solve the solution’s scaling challenge

This methodology enables to separate the concerns for each problem, find structuring solutions and scale them later on, only if working on a small scope and needed.

![Migration Challenge Journey](/blogs/migration-challenge-journey.png)
>Figure 3: The summary of the architecture migration process at Airbnb.

Airbnb went through this process implementing the following practices:

1. Provide infrastructure as code to improve developer’s productivity
2. Clarify ownership and improve with tooling & observability
3. Define a new architecture supported by organization & methods
4. Lead a deprecation working group to accelerate the migration

Let’s see how each of these problems were solved.

### 1. Provide infrastructure as code to improve developer’s productivity
When business change capability depends on software, slow and faulty software development directly impacts the company’s competitiveness.

With experience in the Microservices architecture, Airbnb had invested in automation and tooling. But faster cycles were required in an evolving set of technologies.
![A number of interdependent actions were required for services at Airbnb.](/blogs/services-at-airbnb.png)
>Figure 4: A number of interdependent actions were required for services at Airbnb.

The pragmatic solution is to invest in infrastructure-as-code in a single repository, enabling to gradually increase the adoption of services in parallel.

When more services are operated, the scaling challenge of understanding such complexity arises.

### 2. Clarify ownership and improve with tooling & observability
There were so many Microservices tied together; even small changes led to interdependent changes and impacts, complex to master.
![Scalling challenge](/blogs/scalling-challenge.png)
>Figure 5: The dependency graph shows the complexity of services.

Airbnb invest in productivity improvements focusing on supporting the new architecture on 3 areas:

- Ownership
- Observability
- Tooling.
#### Ownership
Airbnb deploys “Scry Ownership”, an application master of the technical component’s ownership data such as owners, maintainers, communication channels.
![Airbnb ownership application for ownership metadata.](/blogs/ownership-metadata.png)
>Figure 6: Airbnb ownership application for ownership metadata.

#### Observability
A series of observability dashboards are set up to systematically review practices implemented. Here’s an example of the dashboard to track ownership being set:
![Airbnb observability dashboard for services ownership.](/blogs/observability.png)
>Figure 7: Airbnb observability dashboard for services ownership.

#### Tooling
A challenge remains in the data space. Be-spoke [Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/) schemas are useful serializers and data descriptors, but they require other components to retrieve data in products.

Airbnb’s take the advantage of GraphQL to build a unified data access layer that directly provides querying capabilities.
![Airbnb unified access layers with GraphQL.](/blogs/thrift-graphql.png)
>Figure 8: Airbnb unified access layers with GraphQL.

Code generation is the last piece to improve developer productivity. With more technologies, templates are provided for standard components of each layer.

Data access is even embedded by design with code annotation clarifying the data type and access classification directly in the code.
![Airbnb code generation tooling embedding data access.](/blogs/airbnb-code-generation.png)
>Figure 9: Airbnb code generation tooling embedding data access.

When the stars seem aligned, another problem of velocity appears. This time, the central data aggregator components become a limiting factor.

### 3. Define a new architecture supported by organization & methods
The central data aggregator has too slow build and deploy times for the teams to iterate on time.

Even with productivity improvements, the structural complexity accumulated is too high to be handled in central components. A new organization is required.

Entropy is the natural tendency of a system to become more complex over-time, requiring supporting and counter-forces to equilibrate the ecosystem.

Quality Engineering forces enter in action with the domains of _Architecture, Organization and [Methods](https://qeunit.com/blog/this-is-why-you-need-methods-for-quality-at-speed/)_.

#### Architecture to support the growth
It was too complex; teams had to perform slow and costly impacts analysis over different domains, coordinate multiple teams, and correct side-effects bugs.

Let’s analyze the “Microservices-only architecture” cascading issue tree:

- The complexity is overly distributed in fine-grained services
- These fine-grained Microservices lack stable points of collaboration
- The missing glue ends up distributed among components and teams
- Even small changes tend to result in mixed impacts.
The core problem is the lack of urbanization, resulting in a lack of modularity and separation of concerns for both Monolith or Microservices architectures.

Airbnb embraces a new architecture style _Micro+macroservices_:
![Airbnb architecture applies separation of concerns per service.](/blogs/micro-macroservices.png)
>Figure 10: Airbnb architecture applies separation of concerns per service.

In such architecture, each type of complexity is distributed is a clear layer:

- **Unified APIs** are Microservices supporting quick product iterations
- **Central data aggregator** are stable monolith’s glue with tight coupling
- **Service block facade APIs** abstract Microservices providing entity blocks.

#### Organization alignment support the new architecture
An organization designed to support the business objectives can be a game-changer in transformation. The alignment was crucial for Airbnb to accelerate.

The organization is aligned on the evolving architecture with product teams working on top of Unified APIs, data aggregation teams on the central data layer (i.e. “the glue”), and domain platform teams (reservation, user) for each data facet.

>Figure 11: Airbnb organization supports the new architecture responsibilities.

#### Methods enforce paved-path to new architecture
_Architecture review, IT committee, craft governance_ — these are all methods used to review proposed solutions against the current context and future architecture.

The value of such methodology is to act as a counter-force, external from a project context driven by other objectives, to equilibrate choices.

Airbnb enforced a paved-path to the _Micro+macroservices_ architecture using these methods.
![The review process ensures solutions fit in the defined architecture.](/blogs/airbnb-defined-architecture.png)
>Figure 12: The review process ensures solutions fit in the defined architecture.

Even if not covered, the Management of Airbnb surely had a great effect on leading the transition and evolving the culture on the new model, as well as developing the _Skills_, completing the scope of [MAMOS](http://qeunit.com/mamos/).

Equipped with these changes, Airbnb is able to lead parallel tracks of migration. But deprecating the Monolith still takes too much time.

### 4. Lead a deprecation working group to accelerate the migration
Changing our bank account alone can already be a nightmare. The task is even more complex when it takes years to accomplish with multiple teams to coordinate.

Airbnb is like a lot of other organizations with legacy systems and on-going business: they cannot dynamite the house they are living in while building the new one.

A specific organizational unit is dedicated to accelerate the migration out of the monolith, leading the following:

- **Mobile app deprecation > 12 months** for results
- **Elevate & track monolith debt** for visibility
- **Sunset low usage endpoints** to accelerate removal
- **Long-term ownership** of the migration
- **Recognize depreciation as impactful** for valorization.
This group has a lobbying counter-force but is essential to achieve the objective of migration. Deprecating the monolith cannot be “everyone’s responsibility”.

When this task will be accomplished, other challenges would have been faced.

## Airbnb’s Architecture Journey to Quality Engineering
This perspective of Airbnb’s architecture evolution has concrete Quality Engineering takeaways for Quality at Speed software.

First, the differentiation between a localized or a scaling problem enables a better identification of the underlying causes, and so of incremental solutions to adopt.

In a Lean approach, Airbnb’s teams worked on problems when they faced them, avoiding waste like unnecessary pre-optimizations.

One actionable takeaway lies in the architecture from my perspective, the other elements of MAMOS being an alignment of this structuring block.

Starting with a Monolith in a Monorepo is the way to start, to then divide it based on the business evolution, like they did with two repositories.

Their story then exemplifies issues of a “Microservices-only architecture”, replaced by the Micro+macroservices architecture, with a delayed feedback loop.
